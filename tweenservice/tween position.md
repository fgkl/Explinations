## usage of tweenposition
```lua
local frame = script.Parent.Parent
	frame:TweenPosition(UDim2()) -- this will change the Frame Position with an animation, here is how a Position should look like: {0.301, 0},{0.207, 0} you can keep the {} if you want but  you don' have to
	-- how to get the Position:
	--[[
	StarterGui<URScreenUi<UrFrame<properties<Position
	--]]
```
