## usage of tweensize
```lua
local frame = script.Parent.Parent
frame:TweenSize(UDim2()) -- this will change the Size Frame  with an animation, here is how a size should look like: {0, 506},{0, 234} you can keep the {} if you want but you don't have to
	--  how do I get the frame size?:
	--[[
	StarterGui<URScreenUi<UrFrame<properties<Size
	--]]
    ```
